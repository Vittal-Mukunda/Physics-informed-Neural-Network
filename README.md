# Physics-informed-Neural-Network
This PINN approximates the solution of the damped harmonic oscillator differential equation across varying damping ratios. It takes dimensionless time and damping ratio as inputs and predicts displacement. By minimizing the PDE residual and initial condition losses, it learns physics-consistent solutions without needing large datasets.
